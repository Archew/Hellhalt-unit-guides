    <h1>Welcome to the Mining Guide</h1>
    <p>This guide will walk you through the basics of playing mines efficiently in the game.</p>

    <h2>Unopposed Values to Keep in Mind</h2>
    <p>If you don't know what unopposed is, it refers to the value you must be above on a level to earn gold from all the creeps. This value is 40% of the "recommended" value given by the game but may vary by ±5 gold.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> Need 280 value</li>
        <li><strong>Level 3:</strong> Need 465 value</li>
        <li><strong>Level 4:</strong> Need 720 value</li>
    </ul>

    <p>After Level 4, you generally won’t have to worry about unopposed values.</p>

    <h2>General Tips</h2>
    <p>Make sure you <strong>TAUNT</strong> the mines that need to be focused, especially on Level 4 and 5. This applies aggro, preventing units from running past and triggering the wrong mines.</p>

    <h2>Level-by-Level Strategy</h2>

    <h3>Level 1</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Push 4/1 (3 wisp + 1 lumber).</li>
        <li>Build 250 value: 3 medium mines, 1 small mine.</li>
        <li>The small mine should NOT be at the end; place it as the 2nd or 3rd mine to delay units.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Level 2</h3>
    <p>Push depends on game speed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fast Game:</strong> Build 5 medium mines. Push 5-2 going into farm upgrade without stopping your push. May leak slightly due to RNG, but that’s fine as a miner.</li>
        <li><strong>Slow Game:</strong> Go 5-1, upgrade farm first, and hold with 280 value by adding 3 small mines.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Level 3</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure you have over 465 value.</li>
        <li>End your build with an ultra mine to explode the final clump of units.</li>
        <li>Fast game: Go up to 650 value by upgrading 2 medium mines to ultras.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Level 4</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Push 9/4 (or 9/5 if the game is slow and you're experienced).</li>
        <li>Alternate ultra and medium mines to handle low-health units.</li>
        <li>Build 1060 value mines: Ultra → Medium → Ultra → Ultra → Medium → Ultra → Medium.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Level 5</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Push 9/5 if you don’t expect a send. Wyverns make this level tough.</li>
        <li>Upgrade medium mines to ultras—aim for 6 ultra mines by Level 6.</li>
        <li>Add 4 small mines at the beginning to delay and stack units for later explosions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Level 6</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Easy level. Push 9/8 if there’s enough time.</li>
        <li>Add a few delay mines if necessary, but usually not required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Level 7</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Build 7 ultra mines and use small mines to delay and stack units.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Level 8</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In a good scenario, you need 9 ultra mines—usually safer with 10.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Level 9</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Preferred push: 9/10 max. 9/11 is risky and may reduce team gold from leaks.</li>
        <li>Help your teammate if they need it. Ask if they have "fullsell" and build big tank units to assist with Level 10.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Level 10</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You won’t hold this level alone.</li>
        <li>Consider adding small delay mines to avoid backstabbing your teammate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Level 11 and Beyond</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Focus on upgrading to ultra mines while helping your teammate if needed.</li>
        <li>Stick to 3 vertical build lines—avoid spreading horizontally.</li>
        <li>Once you reach 8000–9500 mine value or a bit less, prioritize helping your teammate’s lane until Level 17 ends.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Post-Level 13 Strategy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>After Level 13 (especially Level 14), consider pushing beyond 9/10 if your setup allows.</li>
        <li>Adjust your build if you roll special units like plague.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Post-Level 17 Strategy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It is time to stop playing mines. if you made sure to sack some small mines along the way, or if you just have enough mines, sack all your mines into your seraphim and prepare your build to hold lvl 18. Asking your teammate to help you survive 18 by building is also good, so you dont lose the value before you complete the transition. as u can tell, lvl 18 is 9000 value, that is why you dont want mines to eclipse the value you need on seraphim, but if you do you can put it on a wall in spawn and it might lessen the initial aggro on your seraphim in middle, making it easier for your revive unit to survive</li>
        
    </ul>
